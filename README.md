Project: CPY Language to Assembly Translator

This project was developed as part of the "Translators" lesson within the Unit of Inquiry (UOI). It focuses on creating a simple translator that converts a custom, small programming language (CPY) into Assembly language. The project also includes test cases to validate the functionality and accuracy of the translation process.

Key aspects of the project include:

Designing and implementing a translator tool for converting CPY language to Assembly.
Understanding the principles of language translation and compiler design.
Testing the translator with various code examples to ensure correct translation from CPY to Assembly.
This project allowed me to gain practical experience in language translation concepts, low-level programming, and the role of translators in software development.
